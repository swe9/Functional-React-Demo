# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# What is this?

This is a demo app that implements an infinitely scrolling grid of Giphy images from the Giphy API for trending GIFs.

It uses the new functional component approach to React and is wrapped with the new Redux.

It is bare-bones on the UI, the idea was to quickly create a React app that does something interesting.
